Sarcasm Detection from News Headlines üì∞ü§ñ
Overview
This project implements a Sarcasm Detection model using news headlines. The goal is to classify whether a given headline is sarcastic or not using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning/deep learning models.

Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled news headlines where:

1 ‚Üí Sarcastic headline
0 ‚Üí Non-sarcastic headline
Approach
Data Preprocessing

Text cleaning (removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters)
Tokenization and vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or embeddings)
Model Training

Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
Deep Learning: LSTM, Bi-LSTM, or Transformer-based models
Performance Evaluation

Confusion Matrix for visualizing predictions
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using a Confusion Matrix, showing:

True Positives (TP) ‚Üí Correctly classified sarcastic headlines
True Negatives (TN) ‚Üí Correctly classified non-sarcastic headlines
False Positives (FP) ‚Üí Non-sarcastic headlines misclassified as sarcastic
False Negatives (FN) ‚Üí Sarcastic headlines misclassified as non-sarcastic
üñ•Ô∏è The confusion matrix helps in understanding model performance and identifying areas for improvement.
